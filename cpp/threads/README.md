# First attempt

**RM**: *write c++ code to illustrate threads*

**GPT**: Sure, here's a simple example of using threads in C++ using the &lt;thread&gt; library:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

using namespace std;

void threadFunction(int threadId) {
    cout << "Thread " << threadId << " started." << endl;
    // Do some work...
    cout << "Thread " << threadId << " finished." << endl;
}

int main() {
    // Create 3 threads
    thread t1(threadFunction, 1);
    thread t2(threadFunction, 2);
    thread t3(threadFunction, 3);

    // Wait for all threads to finish
    t1.join();
    t2.join();
    t3.join();

    return 0;
}
```
In this example, we define a function `threadFunction` that takes an integer parameter threadId and prints a message indicating that the thread has started, does some work (which we've left out for simplicity), and then prints a message indicating that the thread has finished.

In main, we create three threads `t1`, `t2`, and `t3`, each of which is passed the threadFunction and a unique integer threadId as arguments. We then wait for all three threads to finish by calling join on each of them in turn.

When we run this program, we should see output that looks something like this:

```
Thread 1 started.
Thread 2 started.
Thread 3 started.
Thread 1 finished.
Thread 2 finished.
Thread 3 finished.
```
This indicates that all three threads started and finished in the expected order.

**Richard Morris**: *now let the thread communicate using a queue, with three threads sending messages to the queue and a a forth thread reading from it.*

**GPT**: Sure! Here's an example of how you could modify the previous code to add a message queue and allow threads to communicate through it:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <queue>
#include <mutex>
#include <condition_variable>

using namespace std;

// Define a message queue class that will hold messages to be sent between threads
class MessageQueue {
public:
    // Add a message to the queue
    void push(const string& message) {
        lock_guard<mutex> lock(mutex_);
        queue_.push(message);
        cond_var_.notify_one();
    }

    // Get the next message from the queue (blocks until a message is available)
    string pop() {
        unique_lock<mutex> lock(mutex_);
        cond_var_.wait(lock, [this] { return !queue_.empty(); });
        string message = queue_.front();
        queue_.pop();
        return message;
    }

private:
    queue<string> queue_;
    mutex mutex_;
    condition_variable cond_var_;
};

// Define a function that will run in each thread and send messages to the message queue
void sendMessages(MessageQueue& queue, int threadId) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        // Generate a message with the thread ID and message number
        string message = "Thread " + to_string(threadId) + " message " + to_string(i);

        // Send the message to the message queue
        queue.push(message);
    }
}

// Define a function that will run in the receiver thread and read messages from the message queue
void receiveMessages(MessageQueue& queue) {
    while (true) {
        // Get the next message from the message queue (blocks until a message is available)
        string message = queue.pop();

        // Print the message to the console
        cout << "Received message: " << message << endl;

        // Check if we've received all the messages
        if (message == "Thread 3 message 4") {
            break;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Create a message queue object
    MessageQueue queue;

    // Create three sender threads and one receiver thread
    thread t1(sendMessages, ref(queue), 1);
    thread t2(sendMessages, ref(queue), 2);
    thread t3(sendMessages, ref(queue), 3);
    thread t4(receiveMessages, ref(queue));

    // Wait for all threads to finish
    t1.join();
    t2.join();
    t3.join();
    t4.join();

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we define a `MessageQueue` class that holds messages to be sent between threads. The `push` function adds a message to the queue, and the `pop` function gets the next message from the queue (blocking until a message is available).

We then define a `sendMessages` function that runs in each sender thread. This function generates a series of messages (using the thread ID and message number) and sends them to the message queue using the push function.

We also define a `receiveMessages` function that runs in the receiver thread. This function reads messages from the message queue using the pop function and prints them to the console.

Finally, in main, we create the message queue and four threads (three senders and one receiver) and wait for them all to finish using join.

When we run this program, we should see output that looks something like this:

```
Received message: Thread 1 message 0
Received message: Thread 1 message 1
Received message: Thread 2 message 0
Received message: Thread 2 message 1
Received message:
```

**Richard Morris**: *Whats the  `ref(queue)` statment do?*

**GPT**: The `ref(queue)` statement is a C++ function that returns a reference to the queue object, which is passed as an argument to the sendMessages function.

In C++, when you pass an object to a function by value, a copy of the object is made, and any changes made to the object within the function are made to the copy, not the original object. This can be inefficient if the object is large or if you need to modify the original object.

To avoid making a copy of the queue object when it's passed to the `sendMessages` function, we use the `ref` function to pass a reference to the queue object instead. This means that changes made to the queue object within the function are made to the original object, not a copy.

In short, `ref(queue)` is a shorthand way of passing a reference to the queue object to the `sendMessages` function, which allows us to modify the original object within the function.

**Richard Morris**: When compiling this gives an undefined reference to `pthread_create`

**GPT**: The error "undefined reference to pthread_create'" indicates that the linker is unable to find the `pthread_create` function, which is part of the POSIX threads library.

To resolve this error, you need to link your program with the pthread library. In most cases, you can do this by adding the -pthread flag to your compile command. For example, if you're using GCC, you can compile and link your program like this:

```
g++ -pthread myprogram.cpp -o myprogram
```

The -pthread flag tells the compiler to link your program with the pthread library, which provides the pthread_create function and other thread-related functions.

If you're using a different compiler or build system, you may need to consult its documentation to determine how to link with the pthread library.
